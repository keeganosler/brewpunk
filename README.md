# Brewpunk - ARCHIVED - new project is BrewpunkBeerfinder

This is a simple frontend project used to practice Angular and Material by playing with the [Brewdog Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2).

The app has 3 main features:

* CUSTOMIZE: find a beer that fits your tastes by using slider toggles to find your ideal mix of beer features (ABV, hops, etc)
* RANDOM: generate a random beer
* SEARCH: search for a beer name by substring
